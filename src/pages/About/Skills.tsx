                        My journey in software engineering started well before it became my profession. Back in the early days of the web, I was inspired by my love for video games and anime, which led me to build my first websites. In 1996, I was using tools like Microsoft FrontPage, Netscape Composer, GeoCities, and Tripod to experiment with web development. By high school in 2002, I had upgraded to Macromedia Dreamweaver, which really solidified my interest in coding and systems design. It wasn't just a hobby anymore – it was something I knew I wanted to do long-term.
                    </p>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Over the years, my career has evolved into full-stack development across different industries, always with a focus on creating systems that are scalable, maintainable, and high-performance. I'm a big advocate of domain-driven design (DDD), which helps me align technical implementations with the real needs of the business. This approach lets me build around specific business logic, encapsulating it within bounded contexts to keep everything clean and organized.
                    </p>
                    <h4 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Frontend Development</h4>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        When it comes to frontend development, I prefer React because it allows me to build reusable, composable components that simplify development, especially in larger applications. For bundling, I like Vite for its fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and simple setup, which is particularly useful in TypeScript projects where real-time feedback is critical.
                    </p>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        For styling, I often combine Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI. Tailwind's utility-first approach lets me quickly prototype UI elements without diving into custom CSS, while DaisyUI provides accessible, pre-styled components that ensure a consistent look and feel across the application.
                    </p>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Accessibility is a priority for me because it's simply a non-negotiable part of modern web design. I make sure every interface works seamlessly across devices and assistive technologies by implementing ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. I also bake in internationalization (i18n) from the start, using tools like react-i18next to make localization easy for global users.
                    </p>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        For testing, I go with Bun Test for unit and integration tests, especially given its fast performance and native integration with the Bun runtime. I also use React Testing Library to verify that my components behave as expected. On top of that, DataDog RUM and Google Analytics help me track real user interactions, which I use to continuously improve both the user experience and performance.
                    </p>
                    <h4 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Backend Development</h4>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        On the backend, I focus on building scalable microservices using the right language and framework for the job.

                    </p>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        For high-performance systems – whether it's a gRPC or REST API, media transcoding pipeline, or a real-time application – I'll opt for Go. It handles concurrency really well and performs efficiently under heavy loads. If I'm dealing with more flexible workflows, like data pipelines or machine learning tasks, I lean toward Python because its vast ecosystem and tools like Apache Airflow and Spark make it easy to work with large datasets or complex processes.
                    </p>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Data handling is something I take seriously, and I use both SQL and NoSQL databases depending on the project. I tend to choose PostgreSQL or DynamoDB based on the data model and use Redis for caching. I often integrate with messaging systems like SQS or Kafka for handling async workflows.
                    </p>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        I like to follow clean architecture principles, focusing on modularity and separation of concerns. This ensures that the codebase stays maintainable and flexible as new features or requirements come up. To monitor everything, I use DataDog and Prometheus for real-time insights into service performance, capturing key metrics like response times, memory usage, and error rates. This helps me spot bottlenecks early and optimize proactively.
